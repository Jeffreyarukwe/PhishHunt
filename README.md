# PhishHunt

PhishHunt is a project I've developed aimed at utilizing AI-driven techniques for phishing detection. This repository contains an implementation in the form of a Jupyter Notebook (`AI_Driven_Phishing_Detection.ipynb`).


## Overview

Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations alike. They often involve deceptive emails, websites, or messages crafted to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, or personal information. Detecting and preventing phishing attacks is crucial to maintaining cybersecurity.

This project explores the application of artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, to detect phishing attempts automatically. The notebook provides insights into the dataset used, the preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques, and the implementation of a machine learning model for classification.

## Contents

- **AI_Driven_Phishing_Detection.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main implementation of the AI-driven phishing detection system. It includes code, explanations, and visualizations to understand the process thoroughly.

## Usage

To use the PhishHunt project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Jeffreyarukwe/PhishHunt.git`.

2. **Navigate to the Notebook**: Open the `AI_Driven_Phishing_Detection.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. **Execute the Notebook**: Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to understand the process and run the code.

4. **Customize and Experiment**: Feel free to customize the code, experiment with different machine learning algorithms, or modify the feature extraction techniques to improve phishing detection.
